# strollerTransitNYC

Uses [Transitland](https://www.transit.land/) to find routes.

This project aims to combined data from [MTA Open Data](https://www.mta.info/open-data) to create a particular tool for my specific use-case with public transit: getting around with a stroller! Accessibility information online is helpful but not complete. Sometimes I might be willing to boost the stroller down a flight of steps - but not 5 flights of steps, for example. Or I know I can get help with the stroller on my way downtown, but not necessarily on the way uptown (say I'm heading out as my husband goes to work.) Google maps is useful but they never allow me to walk as much as I want. For example, I'd rather walk 20 minutes with a stroller than have to transfer trains at Times Square.

Ideally, when finished, this project will provide:
- [ ] Options for accessible stations at either or both ends
- [ ] Querying the "elevators out of service" API for up to date information
- [ ] options to adjust how much walking on either or both ends
- [ ] Route preferences akin to [MTA Trip Planner](https://www.mta.info/tripplanner/results)
